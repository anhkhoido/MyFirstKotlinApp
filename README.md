# MyFirstKotlinApp
This is my first Android app developed with Kotlin. The app is experimental. It allows me to cover fundamentals such as activities, fragments, localizations and so much more. The main silver lining of returning to the basics is the acquisition of the necessary knowledge in order to develop the video game I have had in my head for eons.
